# Technical Test Instructions for Node.js/TypeScript Developer

## Objective

Your task is to extend an existing Node.js web application by adding new features that simulate a real-world scenario. You will:

- Add a new endpoint that allows users to receive personalized recommendations based on their interests.
- Save these recommendations in a in memory cache. 
  - bonus: Save these recommendations in a database.
- Add another endpoint to retrieve saved recommendations for each user.
- Integrate with a mock Large Language Model (LLM) agent using a provided Docker Compose setup.
- create a frontend to interact with the backend

This task assesses your ability to integrate external services, handle HTTP requests/responses, and write clean, maintainable code following best practices. 
### Note: you can change any file on this project, as long as you provide a working code OR enough code that can you can explain you choices.
## Project Overview

You are provided with a basic project structure of a web application built using Express.js and TypeScript. The application currently has a few endpoints set up. Your job is to:

1. **Add a new endpoint `/recommendations`** that generates and saves personalized recommendations.
    - Integrate with a mock LLM agent, accessible via Docker Compose, to generate recommendations.
    - Save recommendations in a database (you'll need to add a in memory cache.
  
2. **Add another endpoint `/users/:user_id/recommendations`** to retrieve saved recommendations.
    - Ensure proper error handling and input validation.

3. **Create a frontend using React that uses those two endpoints**
   - there is no restriction on component library or tools you use
   - create is based on the mockup provided

4. **Write unit tests** for your new code.
  
5. **Document your work** and provide instructions on how to run the application.

## Task Details

### 1. create the FrontEnd based on the muckup provided
- **Create Add a React app that will be based on the mockup provided**:
  - it is recommended to use NextJS and shadcn, but any component library will work.
  - this can be served using the existing server, or you can create another server to serve the new FE app.
  - if you decide to add a new app, make sure to add it to the docker compose file.
  - the frontend should be mobile compatible and look good both and dsektop and on mobile.

### 2. Start the Mock LLM Agent

- Use the provided `docker-compose.yml` file to start the mock LLM agent.
- LLM Agent URL: The mock LLM agent will be accessible at `http://localhost:8080`.

### 3. Create a New Endpoint `/recommendations`

- **Method**: POST
- **Description**: Accepts a JSON payload containing user preferences, generates personalized recommendations using the mock LLM agent, saves them in the cache, and returns them in the response.
- **Request Body Example**:
  ```json
  {
    "user_id": "12345",
    "preferences": ["science fiction", "artificial intelligence", "space exploration"]
  }
  ```
- **Response Body Example**:
  ```json
  {
    "user_id": "12345",
    "recommendations": [
      "Book: 'Dune' by Frank Herbert",
      "Article: 'The Future of AI in Space Travel'",
      "Movie: 'Interstellar'"
    ]
  }
  ```

#### Real-World Scenario

This endpoint simulates a feature in a content platform where users receive content recommendations based on their interests.

### 4. Save Recommendations in an in memory cache

- **Data Persistence**:
  - Save each user's recommendations in an in memory cache

bonus:
- **Database Setup**:
  - Add a MongoDB database service to the `docker-compose.yml` file.
  - Configure the database connection in your application.
  - Define models/schemas using Mongoose.
- **Data Persistence**:
  - Save each user's recommendations in the database with the `user_id` as a reference.
  - Ensure that data is stored securely and efficiently.

### 4. Create Another Endpoint `/users/:user_id/recommendations`

- **Method**: GET
- **Description**: Retrieves saved recommendations for a given `user_id`. If the user hasn't requested any recommendations yet, return a 404 error.
- **Response Body Example (Success)**:
  ```json
  {
    "user_id": "12345",
    "recommendations": [
      "Book: 'Dune' by Frank Herbert",
      "Article: 'The Future of AI in Space Travel'",
      "Movie: 'Interstellar'"
    ]
  }
  ```
- **Error Response Example (User Not Found)**:
  ```json
  {
    "error": "No recommendations found for user_id 12345."
  }
  ```

### 5. Integrate with the Mock LLM Agent

- **LLM Agent Interaction**:
  - Send a POST request to `http://localhost:8080/llm/generate` with the user's preferences.
  - The mock LLM agent will return a list of recommendations based on the provided preferences.
- **LLM Agent Request Example**:
  ```json
  {
    "preferences": ["science fiction", "artificial intelligence", "space exploration"]
  }
  ```
- **LLM Agent Response Example**:
  ```json
  {
    "recommendations": [
      "Book: 'Dune' by Frank Herbert",
      "Article: 'The Future of AI in Space Travel'",
      "Movie: 'Interstellar'"
    ]
  }
  ```

### 6. Error Handling and Input Validation
- **Input Validation**:
  - Ensure that `user_id` is provided and is a non-empty string.
  - Ensure that `preferences` is a non-empty array of strings.
- **Error Handling**:
  - Handle scenarios where the LLM agent returns an error or is unreachable.
  - Return appropriate HTTP status codes and error messages.
  - **Error Response Example**:
    ```json
    {
      "error": "Unable to fetch recommendations at this time. Please try again later."
    }
    ```

### 7. Documentation

## Getting Started

(For Your Reference)

Below is a brief guide to help you set up the project environment.

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-directory>
```

### 2. Set Up the Environment

- **Node.js Dependencies**:
  ```bash
  npm install
  ```

- **Docker Services**: Start all services using Docker Compose:
  ```bash
  docker-compose up
  ```

### 3. Run the Application

Start the Node.js application:
```bash
npm run dev
```

### 4. Test the Endpoints

- **Generate Recommendations**:
  ```bash
  curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/recommendations" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{ "user_id": "12345", "preferences": ["science fiction", "artificial intelligence", "space exploration"] }'
  ```

- **Retrieve Recommendations**:
  ```bash
  curl -X GET "http://localhost:8000/users/12345/recommendations"
  ```

### 5. Run Tests

```bash
npm test
```

**: Note**: Replace `<repository-url>` and `<repository-directory>` with the actual URL and directory name of your Git repository.

## Additional Information

- **Mock LLM Agent Endpoint**: `http://localhost:8080/llm/generate`
- Feel free to enhance the project structure and configuration as you see fit, as long as the core requirements are met. It is recommended to look at the different options for the LLM Agent Endpoints!

### Additional Notes

- **Error Handling**: The application includes basic error handling. Feel free to enhance it to cover more edge cases.
- **Testing**: The tests provided are basic and serve as a starting point. Expand them to cover more scenarios as required.
- **Logging**: Currently, console logs are used for simplicity. In a production environment, consider using a logging library.
- **Environment Variables**: For sensitive data and configuration, use environment variables or a configuration management system.

Good luck!

## Run the application
- All services are configured with docker so just run `docker compose up -d` or with no cache `docker compose buid --no-cache && docker compose up -d`
- FE will run on http://localhost:3000

## Assumptions
- For now we authantication is not implemented so I am taking userId from submitted form and storing to cookies, If you update the customer id in form, it will auto update in cookies and then you can only cat get stored data for that user id.
